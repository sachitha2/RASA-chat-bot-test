  utter_neck_pain:
  - text: "Two sleeping positions are easiest on the neck: on your side or on your back. If you sleep on your back, choose a rounded pillow to support the natural curve of your neck, with a flatter pillow cushioning your head."

  utter_spinal_pain:
  - text: "The best position to avoid back pain is lying flat on your back. Even so, many people find it the hardest way to enjoy deep sleep. For optimal spine alignment, place one pillow underneath your head or neck and another underneath your knees."

  utter_stress:
  - text: "Specifically, sleeping on the side or back is considered more beneficial than sleeping on the stomach. In either of these sleep positions, it's easier to keep your spine supported and balanced, which relieves pressure on the spinal tissues and enables your muscles to relax and recover."

  utter_sleep_apnea:
  - text: "Side sleeping with your back mostly straight is the best position for sleep apnea sufferers according to the Sleep Better Council. Research shows that sleeping on the left side reduces sleep apnea even more than sleeping on the right."

  utter_heart_attact:
  - text: "Sleeping on your right side may be the best option for people with heart failure. Although some people think sleeping on your right side could restrict blood flow back to the heart, there's not enough evidence to prove that it's harmful."
